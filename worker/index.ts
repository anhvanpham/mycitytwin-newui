/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SERVING EVERY ITERATION AT ONCE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * An iteration is submitted, marked, and then has to keep working. A marker
 * may open Iteration 1 in week 12, long after Iteration 3 has rewritten the
 * screens it was marked on. So a finished iteration is frozen as a built
 * directory under releases/ and served forever at its own path:
 *
 *   mycitytwin.com/ver-1/   ←  releases/ver-1/   built with --base=/ver-1/
 *   mycitytwin.com/ver-2/   ←  releases/ver-2/   built with --base=/ver-2/
 *
 * Cloudflare serves those files directly and this script never runs for
 * them. It exists for the two requests the asset router cannot answer on its
 * own: the bare domain, and a path inside a version that is not a file.
 *
 * Work in progress does not appear here at all — it goes to a separate
 * Worker on dev.mycitytwin.com, so that deploying it cannot touch a
 * submitted version. See wrangler.dev.jsonc.
 */

/**
 * Where the bare domain leads.
 *
 * Bump this when an iteration is FINISHED, not when one begins. Bumped early
 * it points mycitytwin.com at a half-built version, which is the one URL
 * everybody types from memory.

       * browser to the version root, dropping the query string that carries
       * the whole shared state. `?view=sunlight&d=…&t=…` is the entire point
       * of the link.

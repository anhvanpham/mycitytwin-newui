 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE WHOLE APPLICATION, IN ONE COMPONENT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   Every piece of state the app has, and the decision about which panels
 *   appear over the 3D view. Nothing is drawn here — the scene is one
 *   component and the panels are others. This file only decides what is
 *   true and who gets told.
 *
 * THE STATE THAT MATTERS
 *
 *   view               which screen is showing: the front page, explore,
 *                      a project, a building, or sunlight
 *   selectedKey        which development, by its planning reference
 *   selectedBuildingId which existing building, if one was searched for
 *   layers             proposals on (the "after"), shadows on
 *   date               the day being simulated
 *   minutes            the time of day, as minutes since midnight
 *   receptor           the spot someone clicked to measure, if any
 *   floor, windowSide  the flat being measured, for a standing building
 *   query              the text in both search fields
 *   focusMode, walking the two ways the interface is hidden
 *   playing            the sunlight screen's day, playing on its own
 *
 *   The first six of those are what the address bar carries (urlState.ts).
 *
 * WHAT IS IN HERE, TOP TO BOTTOM
 *   - The state, and the keyboard: Escape for the search, the ground and
 *     focus mode.
 *   - The sun: where it is for the date and hour, and when it rises and
 *     sets.
 *   - Into a headset.
 *   - The chosen place: a development or a searched building, and the
 *     fall-backs when a link names neither.
 *   - What a window in a standing building can see.
 *   - The spot measured on the ground.
 *   - The city's descent, and the day played.
 *   - The comparison screen: today and after, side by side (ComparePage).
 *   - Choosing and clearing a place, and the header's links.
 *   - While the city loads: the front page, or the loading screen.
 *   - Once it is here: the scene, then each screen's panels.
 *
 * WHY THE HOOKS ALL SIT ABOVE `if (!model)`
 *   React requires the same hooks, in the same order, on every render. The
 *   early return below happens while the city is still loading, so any hook
 *   written after it would not run on those first renders — and the moment
 *   the data arrived, the count would change and React would tear the whole
 *   tree down. That bug was written once here. Neither the tests nor the
 *   type checker can see it, because neither of them renders anything.
 *
 * WHAT FLOWS DOWNWARD
 *   The scene is told what to draw and what may be clicked. The panels are
 *   told what to show and are handed functions to call. Nothing reads state
 *   back out; there is exactly one copy of every fact.

            prevents it, silently, and the button simply appears broken.
            The comfort warning therefore sits BESIDE the button rather than
            in front of it.

 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   One answer to one question: has this person asked their operating system
 *   to reduce motion?
 *
 * WHY IT IS A HOOK AND NOT ONLY A CSS MEDIA QUERY
 *   CSS can answer it for the panels, and does — see the block at the end of
 *   ui.css. But the camera is not CSS. A flight across the city is three.js
 *   arithmetic running inside a frame loop, and the only way that loop can
 *   know is to be told. So the preference has to exist as a value as well as
 *   a media query, and both have to be driven by the same signal or they
 *   will disagree.
 *
 * WHY IT LISTENS RATHER THAN READING ONCE
 *   The setting can be changed while the page is open — on some systems it is a
 *   single toggle in Settings, and people who need it often turn it on
 *   partway through precisely because something moved. Reading once at
 *   startup would ignore them until a reload.
 *
 * WHO SHOULD USE IT
 *   Anything that would otherwise animate. When it returns true the correct
 *   behaviour is never "a shorter animation" — it is to arrive at the final
 *   state immediately. Reduced motion is a request to remove the movement,
 *   not to hurry it.

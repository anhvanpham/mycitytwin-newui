/*
 * The sections under the front page (LandingMore) and the shared sources /
 * map key (Sources), rendered to markup and read.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PIN DOWN
 *   - The three figures say exactly what their sources say — the 26% is NOT
 *     labelled as the Hoddle Grid's, the 40% reads as a target — and each
 *     links to the page of the PDF it was read from.
 *   - Every drawing the page asks for exists in public/, so a renamed or
 *     missing file fails here rather than as a broken image on the site.
 *   - The page's structure: h2 sections under the first screen's h1, with
 *     Future work now on its own page.

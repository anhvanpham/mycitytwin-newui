/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE PANELS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   Every panel that sits over the 3D view after the front page, in the
 *   order of this file:
 *
 *   SearchResults    the matches under either search field.
 *   ViewControls     turn, zoom, frame the whole city, focus mode, and the
 *                    card that says how the mouse moves the map.
 *   MapLayers        the layer panel the header's "Map layers" opens.
 *   SubjectHead      the top every subject panel shares: the way back, the
 *                    way out, the address, and either the Overview /
 *                    Sunlight tabs or a "Details" link.
 *   DevelopmentPanel one approved project.
 *   SunlightSheet    the sunlight screen's column: date, season, today or
 *                    after, the measured spot or window, the way to the
 *                    side-by-side comparison, and "How it works".
 *   TimeBar          the dock along the foot of the map: play, the hour on a
 *                    rail through the day, sunrise and sunset, the map key.
 *   BuildingPanel    one existing building.
 *
 * WHY THEY FLOAT
 *   The thing being explained is behind the glass. A full-width page would
 *   cover the city, and the city is the argument — so every panel is a card
 *   or a column on top of a view that never goes away.
 *
 * WHAT THESE COMPONENTS DO NOT DO
 *   They hold no state that matters beyond themselves — which question the
 *   sunlight column is answering, whether a help card is showing. Everything
 *   else is given to them, with a function to call. That is what lets the
 *   same layer list appear on several screens without any of them knowing
 *   about the others.
 *
 * WHERE THE WORDS CAME FROM
 *   Mostly the design. Two deliberate departures, both because the design
 *   promises something the data cannot support yet:
 *
 *     - the shadow sentences do not name a protected public space, because
 *       there is no protected-space data (user story 1.3);
 *     - the layer list shows "Protected public space", "Construction" and
 *       "Environment" locked rather than working, because nothing is behind
 *       them. A named padlock is more honest than a tick box that does
 *       nothing.

 *
 * WHY TURNING IS HERE AND NOT ONLY ON THE MOUSE
 *   It is on the right mouse button, which is a defensible choice — this
 *   view is panned far more than it is spun — and it is the opposite of what
 *   every other 3D tool does. So the first thing anybody tries is a left
 *   drag, the city slides instead of turning, and they conclude it does not
 *   turn.
 *
 *   The mapping is not the fault. The dead end is. Two buttons make the
 *   capability reachable without knowing any mapping at all, and change
 *   nothing for the reader who already found the right one.
 *
 * WHY THE INSTRUCTIONS MOVED IN HERE
 *   They were a line of 13px text floating at the bottom of the screen with
 *   pointer events off — a caption, in the place captions go, which is the
 *   place nobody looks when they are trying to do something. Now they are
 *   behind a button in the group that performs the same three actions, which
 *   is where somebody stuck on "how do I turn this" is already looking.

 * inside it is gone by the time the destination exists, and so is the button
 * that focus was moved to. Focusing synchronously in the key handler put
 * focus on an element React removed a moment later, which dropped the reader
 * back to the top of the document mid-keystroke.
 *
 * A module-level flag outlives the unmount, which is exactly the span that
 * has to be bridged. It is cleared the first time it is read, so a tab
 * switch made with the mouse never steals focus. The Sunlight tab leads to
 * the sunlight column, which has no tabs: there the keyboard is given the

   * point brings the new answer up too -- that is the same event happening
   * again, not a state that is already true.

   * left "Choose another point" and "Clear point" below the fold -- the
   * answer arrived and what to do about it did not, which is the same fault
   * one step further down. The block is shorter than the panel at every
   * width measured, so both fit.
   *

        Both caveats in one place, at the end.

        One of them used to sit between the figure and the buttons — four
        lines of qualification wedged between the answer and the thing to do
        about it, which pushed the actions off the fold and made the reader
        scroll past a disclaimer to reach them. Qualifications belong after
        the thing they qualify, not inside it.

        THE CAVEAT DEPENDS ON WHICH QUESTION WAS ASKED, and getting this wrong
        would be the same class of error as the "total daylight" mislabel.

        The two measurements count different things. The spot outside tests
        the sun against the SUBJECT ONLY, so everything already standing is
        ignored and a spot in somebody else's shadow still reads as sunlit.
        The window tests against every building in the extract, so that
        sentence would be false there — and the things it cannot see are
        different ones: balconies, awnings, the shape of a roof.

/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE HOUR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A dock along the bottom of the map: play, the hour on a rail through the
 * day, and the key to the city's colours — the three things somebody
 * reading the shadow needs while they move it.
 *
 * WHAT IS ON IT, LEFT TO RIGHT
 *   - Play / pause: the day moving on its own (App runs the clock).
 *   - Above the rail: what the shadow is doing, then sunrise and sunset.
 *   - The rail: the daylight band, the handle, and under it the hours
 *     every four from 8:00 am, with the hour itself under the handle.
 *   - A sentence when the sun does not rise or set inside the window.
 *   - The map key.
 *
 *   Every time on the bar is a 12-hour reading (clock12Label).
 *
 * WHAT THE RAIL SAYS
 *   The window runs 06:00 to 20:00 because those are the hours the model
 *   covers, not because the sun does anything at either end. Drawn plain it
 *   claimed the day was a featureless fourteen hours, and somebody dragging
 *   through it had no way to know they had passed sunset until the shadows
 *   went out.
 *
 *   The warm span is the real one, computed for the date on screen by the
 *   same code every other solar figure here uses — see daylightWindow. It
 *   moves when the date moves. Nothing is drawn at a plausible fraction.
 *
 * WHY THERE IS NO LONGER A FILLED PORTION
 *   The track used to carry an amber fill from the start of the window to
 *   the current hour, on top of the daylight band. Two coloured spans on one
 *   rail, both amber, meaning different things: one "the sun is up", one
 *   "you are here". The handle already says where you are, and it says it
 *   without competing with the only other thing the rail has to show.
 *
 * WHERE THE NUMBERS LINE UP
 *   A native range moves its handle's CENTRE between one radius in from each
 *   end, not between the ends. The rail and the scale are inset by the same
 *   radius, so 12:00 on the scale is under the handle when the clock reads
 *   12:00 — which it was not when the rail ran edge to edge.

/* ── An existing building ───────────────────────────────── */

/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * ONE EXISTING BUILDING
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * What is known about one existing building: the same sheet a project
 * gets, for something that is already standing. The counterpart to
 * DevelopmentPanel. Until then a searched building got the nearby-projects
 * list and nothing about itself, so the one thing a resident had actually
 * asked about was the one thing the screen would not describe.
 *
 * The sunlight screen is reachable from here. It was not at first, on the
 * reasoning that a building has no "before" to compare against — but the
 * searched building is already lifted out of the merged city so it can be
 * drawn pink, so the city without it costs nothing to show.
 *
 * WHY IT LOOKS LIKE THE PROJECT PANEL NOW
 *   It was the last panel written before the rest were redesigned, and it
 *   stayed as it was: no back link, no tabs, no progress, a different way of
 *   laying out its figures, and on the opposite side of the screen. A reader
 *   who searched an address got a panel that shared nothing with the one
 *   they had been using a moment earlier, and had to work out its exits from
 *   scratch.
 *
 *   Everything here comes from SubjectHead, so the two cannot drift again.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ON THE LEFT
 *   Because everything else is. It was the one panel in the app on the right
 *   — and its own sunlight half was on the left, so switching tab threw it
 *   across the city and the reader had to find it again.
 *
 *   Which side matters far less than every panel using the same one. A
 *   reader learns where panels appear in the first ten seconds and then
 *   stops looking; a panel that arrives somewhere else is a panel that has
 *   to be searched for.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
 *   This panel does not compare anything: it describes what is standing.
 *   The comparisons live on the sunlight screen, where the building can be
 *   taken away to show what IT takes from the street, and the approved
 *   projects around it added to show what changes.

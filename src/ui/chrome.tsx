/**
 * The credit Mapbox is owed for the map under the city.
 *
 * WHY IT IS HERE RATHER THAN ON THE IMAGE
 *   The Static Images API will draw its own logo and credit into the picture,
 *   and the request turns both off — because the picture is laid flat on the
 *   ground, where the words would be metres long, upside down half the time,
 *   and lit by whatever the sun is doing. Mapbox permits turning them off on
 *   exactly that condition: that the credit appears somewhere legible
 *   instead. This is that somewhere.
 *
 *   So this is not decoration and not a nicety. Removing it while the request
 *   still says logo=false puts the deployment in breach of the terms it is
 *   served under. If it has to go, the parameters in basemap.ts go with it.
 *
 * WHAT THE LINKS ARE
 *   OpenStreetMap is credited alongside Mapbox because the streets, the
 *   river and the parks in that image are OSM's data. "Improve this map" is
 *   required too, and is a real thing: it opens the editor at the place the
 *   reader is looking at.

/**
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE HEADER BAR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT A HEADER IS FOR
 *   The things that are true on every screen, and nothing that belongs to
 *   one. Measured against that, it was carrying two controls it should not
 *   have been — and the argument for removing each is different.
 *
 *   SUNLIGHT & SHADOW is gone because it was never a destination. It needs a
 *   subject, so on arrival it was shown disabled with an explanation; and
 *   once there IS a subject, the panel it would open carries a Sunlight tab
 *   two inches below. It was a permanent control that spent most of its life
 *   inert and the rest of it duplicating something nearer to hand.
 *
 *   FOCUS MODE is gone because it is a view control, and the view controls
 *   live together in the bottom-right corner beside the zoom and the
 *   reframe. It also hides this bar, which makes a button that erases its
 *   own container an odd tenant of that container. It is the same action in
 *   a better place, not a smaller one.
 *
 *   WHERE YOU ARE went the same way, later and for the same reason. It read
 *   "Melbourne CBD" on the map — which the map already says — and became a
 *   back link inside a subject. By then every subject panel had grown its
 *   own back link at the top of itself, nearer the thing it returns from and
 *   naming where it goes, so the one up here was a second answer to a
 *   question already answered.
 *
 *   What is left is what survives the test: who this is, what you are
 *   looking for, and what the map is drawing.
 *
 * TWO LOOKS
 *   The plain bar, with the layer button, on the explore, project and
 *   building screens. The front page's look — the page's cream, the links
 *   "Future plans", "Explore the city" and "How it works", and no layer
 *   button — on the front page and the sunlight screen (`front`, `nav`).
 *
 * WHY THE SEARCH HAS A KEY
 *   It is the one control here somebody uses repeatedly, and reaching for a
 *   mouse to type is the kind of small tax that is only visible in aggregate.
 *   "/" is the convention, it needs no modifier, and the field says so — a
 *   shortcut nobody is told about is a shortcut for the person who wrote it.
 *
 * WHY THE LAYER BUTTON CAN CARRY A MARK
 *   Turning off shadows is invisible from outside the panel that turns them
 *   off. Somebody who does it, navigates away and comes back is looking at a
 *   city with no shadows in a product about shadows, with nothing on screen
 *   to say it was asked for. The mark is the difference between "broken" and
 *   "you turned that off".

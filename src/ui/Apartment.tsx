 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The two questions that turn a building into somebody's flat, and the
 *   answer that comes back. It sits inside the sunlight panel for a building
 *   that is already standing.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT THE SPOT-ON-THE-GROUND FLOW WITH A HEIGHT BOX
 *   Because it is a different question and it deserves different words. The
 *   ground flow asks what ONE PROPOSAL takes from a place. A resident is
 *   asking what reaches their window, and most of what does not reach it is
 *   the city that is already there — see windowSunlight.ts, which counts a
 *   different thing and names it differently for the same reason.
 *
 * WHY THE SIDES ARE NOT EIGHT COMPASS BUTTONS
 *   They are the sides the building actually has, read off its footprint by
 *   facadesOf(). A tower with four square faces should not invite somebody to
 *   say their window faces north-west, because none of them does, and an
 *   answer to a question that could not be right is worse than no answer.

 * own, because App has to know the answers anyway in order to place the
 * marker in the 3D scene and to compute the skyline.
 *
 * `sides` is the list the building actually HAS at the floor being asked
 * about, worked out from its footprint, so it changes as the reader moves up
 * past a podium onto a narrower tower. `floorsAboveGround` is null for most
 * buildings in the extract, and when it is, the note under the stepper says
 * the floor height had to be assumed.

 * MAP COORDINATES  →  METRES

 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The border crossing between how the world describes a place and how a
 *   3D scene describes one. The API sends longitude and latitude; the scene
 *   needs metres east and north of a chosen point. Everything here is that
 *   conversion, plus two small pieces of polygon arithmetic that need it.
 *
 * WHO USES IT
 *   adapter.ts, while it is turning an API response into the model the rest
 *   of the app sees. Nothing downstream ever touches longitude again — with
 *   one deliberate exception: scene/basemap.ts, which has to go back the
 *   other way, because a map image is drawn in a projection of its own and
 *   fitting one to the other is a question about the globe.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST USE LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE
 *   Because they are angles, not distances, and the two axes are not the
 *   same size. In Melbourne one degree of longitude is about 88 km and one
 *   degree of latitude about 111 km. Treating those as if they matched
 *   would squash the city east-to-west by a fifth, and every shadow would
 *   lean by a consistent amount that looks like nothing in particular.

/**
 * A whole building outline, from degrees to local metres.
 *
 * SHAPE OF THE INPUT
 *   A GeoJSON MultiPolygon nests four levels deep:
 *
 *     coordinates[polygon][ring][vertex][lon, lat]
 *
 *   A building is usually one polygon. A polygon is one outer ring plus any
 *   number of inner rings, and an inner ring is a courtyard — a hole.
 *
 * WHAT COMES OUT
 *   The same nesting, but every vertex is [east, north] in metres from the
 *   scene origin, and the duplicated closing vertex is gone.
 *
 * WHY SUBTRACT AN ORIGIN
 *   Projected eastings are seven digits. A GPU stores depth in a float with
 *   about seven significant digits total, so numbers that large leave almost
 *   nothing for the fractional part — and shadows on flat roofs break into
 *   speckle. Subtracting a nearby origin brings every coordinate down to
 *   three or four digits and the problem disappears.
 *
 * WHY KEEP THE HOLES
 *   Because a courtyard is not part of the building. Filling it in would add
 *   mass the building does not have, and mass casts shadow.

 * How much ground a ring covers, in square metres.

 *   running back subtract, and what survives is the enclosed area. The loop

 *   at the last one — that pairs the final vertex with the first and closes
 *   the ring.
 *
 * THE SIGN IS BACKWARDS
 *   This trapezoid form comes out NEGATIVE for a counter-clockwise ring,
 *   the opposite of the textbook shoelace formula. Every caller here takes
 *   the absolute value, so it does not matter — but anybody who uses the
 *   sign to work out which way a ring winds needs to know.

 * WHAT IT IS NOT

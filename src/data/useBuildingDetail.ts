/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT ONE EXISTING BUILDING
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   Fetches the property record behind a building somebody looked up — when
 *   it was built, how many storeys, what it is used for.
 *
 * WHY IT IS FETCHED AND NOT BUNDLED
 *   The footprints endpoint carries geometry for all 4,443 rows and would be
 *   several times larger if it carried every property field too. One request
 *   when a building is actually opened is the cheaper trade.
 *
 * IT IS AN ENHANCEMENT, NOT A REQUIREMENT
 *   The panel renders from what the model already knows — address, height,
 *   footprint — and fills in the rest if and when this arrives. A sleeping
 *   backend costs a few lines of detail, not the screen.
 *
 * NOTE ON NAMING
 *   Fields inside `details` are snake_case, unlike the camelCase everywhere
 *   else in the API. That is the shape it sends; it is translated here rather
 *   than leaking into the interface.

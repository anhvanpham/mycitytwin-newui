/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * TURNING THE API RESPONSE INTO A CITY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The single translation step between the backend and everything else.
 *   One function, `buildCityModel`, takes the two API responses and returns
 *   a `CityModel` — projected, parsed, grouped and checked.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, IN ORDER
 *
 *   1. Work out the scene origin in metres, once.
 *   2. For each building row: parse the numbers, project the outline, decide
 *      how tall the solid is, and check the source against itself.
 *   3. Mark the lowest part of each building, so only that one is allowed to
 *      reach down to the ground plane.
 *   4. Do the same for development rows, then group them by project.
 *   5. Measure the bounds of everything, for the camera and the shadows.
 *
 * THE TWO DECISIONS WORTH UNDERSTANDING
 *
 *   HEIGHTS. Each source row is one roof plane, not one building — a tower
 *   with a podium arrives as several rows sharing a `buildingId`. Of the
 *   4,443 rows, 2,651 start ABOVE ground, because they are upper storeys.
 *   Extruding every one of them from street level would guarantee nothing
 *   floats, but measured against the data it invents solid mass under 201
 *   of them, and invented mass casts invented shadow. So each plane keeps
 *   its own base, and step 3 handles the floating.
 *
 *   BAD ROWS ARE KEPT. 45 rows disagree with themselves about their own
 *   height by up to 11.7 m. They are flagged, not dropped. Deleting a
 *   building deletes its shadow, and a missing shadow reads to a resident
 *   as sunlight — so an error in the data has to come out on the pessimistic
 *   side, not the flattering one.

/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * GETTING THE CITY ONTO THE SCREEN
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The React hook the app calls once, at the top, to obtain the city. It
 *   returns the model, a progress figure while that is happening, and an
 *   error if it never does.
 *
 * THE ORDER IT DOES THINGS, AND WHY
 *
 *   1. Read the two files bundled with the app (public/data/*.json).
 *      These are a copy of the API taken at build time. They are on the
 *      same server as the page, so they arrive in under a second.
 *
 *   2. Build the model from them and hand it back. The city is now on
 *      screen and the user can start.
 *
 *   3. THEN call the real API in the background. If it answers, rebuild
 *      and swap. If it does not, nothing happens and nobody notices.
 *
 *   The staging API runs on a free Render instance, which goes to sleep.
 *   Waking it takes the better part of a minute. Step 1 exists so that a
 *   sleeping backend costs a slightly stale model instead of a blank page
 *   in the middle of a demonstration.
 *
 * THE STRICTMODE TRAP
 *   React runs effects twice in development — mount, unmount, mount. The
 *   guard below handles it, and the comment inside explains why the obvious
 *   fix (a `cancelled` flag) is the wrong one here. It cost an afternoon.

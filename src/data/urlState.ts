/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE VIEW, WRITTEN INTO THE ADDRESS BAR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   Two functions. `readUrlState` turns the query string into the state the
 *   app should start in; `writeUrlState` does the reverse whenever
 *   something changes.
 *
 *   A finished URL looks like this:
 *
 *     ?view=sunlight&dev=X0015700&d=2026-06-21&t=900&at=-532.4,-198.1
 *      │            │            │            │      └ the measured spot
 *      │            │            │            └ minutes since midnight
 *      │            │            └ the simulated date
 *      │            └ which development
 *      └ which screen
 *
 *   An existing building takes `bldg=<id>` in place of `dev=`. Until it did,
 *   half of what the search can find was not linkable at all: sending
 *   somebody a proposal worked, sending them a building silently reopened
 *   on the landing screen.
 *
 * WHY IT MATTERS
 *   User story C.1 asks that somebody be able to come back to a place they
 *   care about "without repeating the same search", and specifically without
 *   an account. A URL does that for nothing: no login, no database, no
 *   personal data to store or lose. Send the link and the other person sees
 *   what you saw.
 *
 * WHY replaceState AND NOT pushState
 *   Dragging the time slider changes the state a hundred times. With
 *   pushState each drag would become a history entry and the browser's back
 *   button would take a hundred presses to leave the page.

 * The state to open in.

 * THE DEFAULT IS NOW, NOT A SOLSTICE
 *   It used to open on 21 December at three in the afternoon — the shortest
 *   shadow of the year, which is the right frame for assessing a worst case
 *   and the wrong one for somebody asking what is happening to their street.
 *   A date the reader has to imagine their way into is a date they have to
 *   translate before the picture means anything.
 *
 *   Opening on the present moment costs nothing: the four solstice and
 *   equinox presets are still one press away, so the worst case has not gone
 *   anywhere. It is simply no longer what a visitor is shown first.
 *
 * WHAT THE URL STILL WINS
 *   Anything the address bar states. A shared link is somebody saying "look
 *   at this, at this hour", and the present moment must not overrule it, or
 *   the link stops meaning what its sender meant.
 *
 * The instant is a parameter so the tests can fix it. Read from the clock
 * inside, every test of this function would depend on the hour it ran at.

/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * SEARCHING THE CITY
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   One function that turns what somebody typed into a ranked list of places
 *   in the model — both the 49 approved projects and the 1,328 existing
 *   buildings that carry an address, plus the supplied 51 CBD landmarks.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT JUST `includes()`
 *   Addresses arrive as "319-323 Swanston Street MELBOURNE VIC 3000", and
 *   sometimes with a building name in front. Somebody typing "swanston" or
 *   "319 swanston" should find it; somebody typing "3000" should not get all
 *   1,328 of them, because the postcode is on every single one.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY MISSING
 *   220 of the 1,548 buildings have no address at all — the property register
 *   could not be matched to their outline. They cannot be found by searching,
 *   and the interface says so rather than letting the gap read as a broken
 *   query.

 * Each finished iteration is frozen and served forever at its own path —
 * mycitytwin.com/ver-1/, /ver-2/, /ver-3/ — so that a marker returning to
 * Iteration 1 in week 12 sees what was submitted, not what has happened
 * since. Vite is told that path at build time and rewrites every import and
 * every URL in index.html to match.
 *
 * It cannot rewrite a string. A path written by hand with a leading slash —
 * data/roads.json addressed as though the app sat at the root — leaves the
 * version it belongs to and asks the root of the domain, which holds no data
 * at all, so the layer silently fails to load.
 *
 * The trap is that this is invisible while developing. The base is '/' then,
 * and an absolute path happens to be correct; the mistake only surfaces in
 * the release build, which is the last one anybody looks at closely. That is
 * what bundled.test.ts is for — the browser will not tell you.

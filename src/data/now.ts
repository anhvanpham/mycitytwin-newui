 * "NOW", AS THE SIMULATION CAN STATE IT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The sunlight screen asks for a date and a time and shows where the sun
 *   is. This turns the present moment into that pair, so a reader can start
 *   from what is happening outside rather than from a solstice they have to
 *   imagine.
 *
 * WHAT IT HOLDS
 *   - EARLIEST_MINUTES / LATEST_MINUTES: the hours the time control covers.
 *   - intoWindow, clampMinutes: a time held inside those hours, and snapped
 *     to the control's ten-minute step.
 *   - presentMoment: the Melbourne clock now, as a date and a time.
 *   - clockLabel: "23:31", the 24-hour reading used wherever a time is a
 *     figure to compare.
 *   - clock12Label: "4:30 pm", the time bar's own labels.
 *   - outsideWindowNote: the sentence shown when the clock is outside the
 *     hours on offer.
 *
 * TWO THINGS IT HAS TO BE HONEST ABOUT
 *
 *   Whose clock. The instant comes from the reader's device and is then read
 *   off a Melbourne clock — see civilInZone, which is where that argument is
 *   made. A reader in Melbourne notices no difference; anyone else would
 *   otherwise be shown a sun that is not the one over the city.
 *
 *   The time control stops at 06:00 and 20:00, and Melbourne spends a large
 *   part of the year outside that. Half past eleven at night is not 20:00,
 *   and quietly showing 20:00 would be the app stating something false about
 *   the sun on a screen whose whole purpose is to be trusted about the sun.
 *   So the clock reading is returned alongside the clamped one, and the
 *   caller is expected to say so.

/**
 * "23:31" — a time on the Melbourne clock.

 *   writes 06:00 for a time at seven o'clock — the right minutes against the
 *   wrong hour. One rounding, then one division, cannot split that way.
 *
 *   No caller passes a fraction today. Both sources of minutes hand over
 *   whole numbers: civilInZone builds them from the hour and minute fields,
 *   and daylightWindow rounds at the end of its bisection. This is the
 *   formatter being total rather than a bug being fixed, and it is written
 *   down because a later change to either source would otherwise arrive as
 *   a sunrise labelled an hour early.
 *
 * AND IT WRAPS, BECAUSE A CLOCK IS A CIRCLE.
 *   Left open the arithmetic produces readings no clock has: 1439.6 rounds
 *   to 1440 and reads 24:00, and a negative reads -1:-1. Neither is a time.
 *   Taking it modulo a day gives 00:00 and 23:59, which are.

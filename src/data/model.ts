 * WHAT THE APP WORKS WITH
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The vocabulary for everything above the data layer. A `Massing` is a
 *   solid the scene can extrude; a `Development` is one approved project
 *   with all its parts; a `CityModel` is the whole thing plus its bounds.
 *
 * HOW IT DIFFERS FROM api-types.ts
 *   Two things, and they are the whole reason both files exist:
 *
 *     coordinates   already metres east and north, never longitude
 *     numbers       already numbers, never strings
 *
 *   So a component that draws a building never converts anything. It reads
 *   `baseAhdM` and `topAhdM` and extrudes between them.
 *
 * WHAT "AHD" MEANS
 *   Australian Height Datum — heights above mean sea level, the same
 *   reference a surveyor uses. Buildings carry their real feet, which is why
 *   the model knows that one standing on higher ground is higher.

/*
 * Distance haze over the ground.
 *
 * WHY THE GROUND CANNOT FADE ITSELF
 *   It used to. Its vertex colours ran from white in the middle to the haze
 *   colour at the rim, and with a plain ground that worked. With a map on it
 *   it stopped working, for two reasons that are both about the material.
 *
 *   A vertex colour MULTIPLIES the texture. At the rim the intended colour
 *   was haze, but what was drawn was haze times whatever the map had there —
 *   so the fade never arrived at the haze colour at all, only at a darker
 *   version of the map.
 *
 *   And the ground is lit and tone-mapped, while the sky it fades into is
 *   neither. Two different colour paths from the same authored value do not
 *   land in the same place, so the horizon showed a seam wherever they met.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD
 *   Lays an unlit, un-tone-mapped ring over the ground, transparent in the
 *   middle and opaque by its rim, in exactly the colour the dome paints below
 *   its horizon. The ground underneath is untouched — still lit, still
 *   receiving shadows — and the far distance becomes the same colour as the
 *   sky's ground by the same arithmetic. There is nothing left to disagree.
 *
 *   Drawn without writing depth, so it cannot occlude the city standing in
 *   it, and offset a metre up so it is not fighting the surface below.

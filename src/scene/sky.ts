 * THE SKY, AND WHAT TIME OF DAY IT IS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   How the sky, the light and the horizon look at a given sun position.
 *   Pure arithmetic; the components that draw it are in SkyDome.tsx.
 *
 * WHY IT IS DRIVEN BY THE SUN AND NOT BY A SETTING
 *   Morning, noon, evening and night are not four buttons here — they are
 *   where the sun is, which this app already computes to a tenth of a degree
 *   against pvlib. A separate control would be a second opinion about the
 *   time of day, and the two would disagree the moment anybody touched
 *   either one.
 *
 *   They are all reachable from the existing 06:00–20:00 slider, which was
 *   worth checking rather than assuming. Measured at Melbourne:
 *
 *     21 Dec 06:00   +0.1°   the sun on the horizon
 *     21 Dec 13:00  +75.1°   high summer noon
 *     21 Jun 12:00  +28.5°   winter noon, and still low
 *     21 Jun 17:30   -4.6°   civil twilight
 *     21 Jun 20:00  -33.0°   full night
 *
 *   So the slider already spans −33° to +75°, and the whole day is in it.
 *   Nothing new had to be added to the controls to reach the dark.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLDS ARE THE REAL ONES
 *   −6° is the end of civil twilight and −18° the end of astronomical
 *   twilight; both are definitions, not taste. Using them means the moment
 *   the app calls it night is the moment an almanac would.
 *
 * A NOTE ON COLOUR
 *   The sky carries no information. It is atmosphere, and every fact the app
 *   states — which buildings are proposals, where the shadow falls — is
 *   carried by geometry and by lightness, never by hue. That matters here:
 *   the sky may not be allowed to close the lightness gap between the ground
 *   and the things standing on it. sky.test.ts holds that gap open.

 * far the sun sinks. Midnight came out the colour of an overcast afternoon,
 * the stars were invisible against it, and covering it up meant stacking one

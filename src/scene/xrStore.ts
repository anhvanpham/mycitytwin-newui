/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ONE XR STORE, AND WHETHER THIS DEVICE CAN USE IT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SINGLETON AND NOT STATE
 *   Two places need it and they are on opposite sides of the renderer. The
 *   button that starts a session is ordinary DOM in App; the <XR> that runs
 *   the session is inside <Canvas>. Threading one object between them through
 *   props would mean App holding a piece of three.js it never uses, and a
 *   context would have to wrap both — which is the same singleton with more
 *   ceremony.
 *
 *   There is also only ever one headset. A second store would be a second
 *   claim on a device that cannot be claimed twice.
 *
 * WHY IT IS BUILT LAZILY
 *   `createXRStore` reaches for `window` when it is made. This module is
 *   imported by App, App is imported by tests, and tests run in Node — where
 *   building it at import time would throw before a single assertion ran.
 *
 * WHY THE SUPPORT CHECK LIVES HERE AND NOT BESIDE THE OTHER FEATURE TESTS
 *   Because on this codebase support is not only a property of the browser.
 *   On localhost the answer depends on the simulated headset this file
 *   installs — see installLocalHeadset below — so "can this page enter VR"
 *   cannot be answered before that has run. Kept in two files, the answer was
 *   computed before the question could be true.
 *
 * THE RULE THIS FILE CANNOT ENFORCE, AND WHICH BREAKS EVERYTHING
 *   A WebXR session may only be started from a real user gesture, and the
 *   gesture expires the moment the handler awaits anything. So the click
 *   handler must call `enterVR()` ITSELF:
 *
 *     onClick={() => xrStore().enterVR()}          // works
 *     onClick={async () => { await x; enterVR() }} // permission denied
 *
 *   The failure is not an exception anybody sees. The headset simply does not
 *   go in, and the button looks broken.

/*
 * ── A HEADSET ON LOCALHOST ───────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * On localhost, and only when asked for with `#vr-sim` on the address, a
 * simulated Meta Quest 3 is installed into `navigator.xr` when no real
 * headset is attached. That is the difference
 * between checking a change by reading it and checking it by walking around
 * in it, without putting a headset on for every typo. The simulator draws
 * its own controls over the page — move the controllers, pull triggers,
 * press X — once a session starts.
 *
 * It cannot answer the questions that actually matter — comfort, whether
 * text is readable at arm's length, whether the shadows survive being looked
 * at from the pavement. Those need the device. It answers the other kind:
 * does the panel's button do what it says, does the stick move the right
 * way, does the wall stop you.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE INSTALLS IT, AND NOT THE LIBRARY
 *   @react-three/xr can do it, and did. It stopped working in Chrome: current
 *   Chrome has a `navigator.xr` of its own on every desktop, headset or not,
 *   and the simulator (IWER 2.4) now treats any existing `navigator.xr` as a
 *   real runtime and declines to replace it — "skipping installRuntime". The
 *   library calls it without the one option that overrides that, so on
 *   localhost the VR button simply never appeared, which looks exactly like
 *   the feature being broken.
 *
 *   So the library's emulator is off, and this does what it did plus
 *   `forceInstall`: ask the browser first whether a REAL headset is there
 *   (a Quest on Link, say, must keep working), and only if not, replace
 *   `navigator.xr` with the simulator.
 *
 * ONLY WHEN ASKED FOR
 *   It used to be installed on every visit to localhost, and that made
 *   localhost a headset: the front page offered "Enter in VR" and the header
 *   "Enter VR" to a desktop that has none, so the page being checked was not
 *   the page a desktop visitor sees. Now localhost is an ordinary desktop
 *   unless the address carries `#vr-sim`. A fragment rather than a query
 *   parameter because the app rewrites the query to match what is on screen
 *   and keeps the fragment (see writeUrlState), so the request survives
 *   that and a reload. `npm run test:vr` opens the page with it.
 *
 * NOT SHIPPED TO ANYBODY
 *   The hostname gate keeps it off dev.mycitytwin.com and the live versions,
 *   and the simulator is a separate chunk that only localhost ever fetches.

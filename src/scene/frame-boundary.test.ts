 * One rule, checked mechanically: `enuToWorld` is for things OUTSIDE
 * <WorldFrame>, and only for those.
 *
 * Inside the frame, x/y/z already mean east/north/up, so converting again
 * scatters the object somewhere meaningless — and the rotations that go with
 * the conversion stand flat things on their edge. That is exactly what
 * happened twice: the street names ended up face-down under the road, and the
 * receptor ring stood vertically in the air. Both were written by copying a
 * component from the other side of the boundary, where the same lines are
 * correct.
 *
 * Reading the source is a blunt instrument, but the failure is invisible to
 * the type system — both sides are three numbers — and the two bugs it has
 * already caused took a person looking at the screen to notice.

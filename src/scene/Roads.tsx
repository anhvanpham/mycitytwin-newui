 * THE ROAD SURFACE

 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   Draws the pale grey of the carriageways. It reads a prepared file rather
 *   than working the shapes out, and the reason is the whole story here.
 *
 * THE FIRST ATTEMPT, AND WHY IT FAILED
 *   Each street was drawn as a long rectangle: take the centreline, give it
 *   a width, done. Measured against the buildings afterwards, 15% of the
 *   painted road was underneath one — and 40% of the narrow lanes.
 *
 *   The reason is simple once seen. A centreline is infinitely thin and can
 *   thread a gap that a 30-metre-wide band cannot. Nudging the lines
 *   sideways did not help: there was nowhere for the band to go.
 *
 * WHAT IS DONE INSTEAD
 *   Offline, once: take the union of all the street bands, then SUBTRACT the
 *   union of all 4,443 building footprints. What is left is road exactly
 *   where no building stands. Not an approximation of the truth — the truth.
 *   Residual overlap measures 0.03%.
 *
 *   A pleasant side effect: where an arcade genuinely bridges a lane, the
 *   road correctly stops and the building covers it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A FILE AND NOT COMPUTED HERE
 *   Subtracting thousands of polygons is heavy geometry, and the answer
 *   never changes. Doing it once and shipping 40 KB is better than doing it
 *   in every visitor's browser. road-surface.test.ts checks the file still
 *   describes a street network.

        The 6 cm above is not enough on its own, and never was.

        Depth precision falls off with the square of the distance: with this
        camera's near of 5 m, one step of the depth buffer is about 5 cm at
        two kilometres and 11 cm at three. Past that the road and the ground
        round to the same depth and flicker between them, which stayed
        invisible only while the two were near enough in colour to hide it. A
        map underneath made it obvious at once.

        polygonOffset is the fix rather than a larger lift, because its units
        are steps of the depth buffer rather than metres — it stays exactly
        one step in front wherever the camera is, instead of being too little
        far away and a visible kerb close up.

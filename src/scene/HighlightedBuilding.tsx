 * THE BUILDING SOMEBODY SEARCHED FOR
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   Draws one existing building in pink, so a search result can be seen in
 *   the city rather than only named in a list.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   - Gathers every roof plane that belongs to the chosen building.
 *   - Welds them into one pink mesh drawn over the background city.
 *   - Outlines them in dark ink (SelectionEdges), so the building can be
 *     found by its lightness as well as its colour.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE OBJECT
 *   The 1,548 background buildings are welded into a single object, which is
 *   what makes the scene fast — but a welded object cannot be coloured in
 *   parts. So the highlighted one is lifted out and drawn on its own, exactly
 *   as the 49 proposals are. One extra object is free; the alternative is
 *   unwelding the city.
 *
 * WHY PINK
 *   Colour in this scene already means something: mint is a proposal, white
 *   is built, grey is data we do not trust. Pink is a fourth meaning — "this
 *   is the one you looked for" — and it has to be unmistakable against mint
 *   in particular, because a search result standing beside a proposal is the
 *   common case. Pink and mint sit on opposite sides of the wheel, which is
 *   why it works where another green would not.
 *
 *   It is deliberately temporary. It says nothing about the building itself,
 *   only about what the person asked for, so it clears the moment the
 *   question changes.
 *
 *   Pink alone was not enough: in a city of pale blocks, under shadow, it
 *   was reported as hard to find, and a colour is exactly what a reader
 *   with a colour-vision difference may not get. Hence the outline.

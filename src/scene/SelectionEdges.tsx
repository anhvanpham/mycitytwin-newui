 * THE CHOSEN BUILDING, OUTLINED
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The dark outline drawn round whichever building has been chosen: the
 *   searched-for building (HighlightedBuilding) and the project being read
 *   about (DevelopmentMassings). It sits inside that building's <mesh>.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   - Turns the building's blocks into line segments (outline.ts).
 *   - Draws them as screen-space lines in a dark ink.
 *   - Thickens the line as the camera pulls back, every frame.
 *
 * WHY AN OUTLINE
 *   The building somebody chose was told apart by colour alone — pink for a
 *   searched building, a brighter mint for the project in focus — and in a
 *   city of pale blocks, under shadow, that was reported as hard to find. A
 *   colour is also exactly what a reader with a colour-vision difference may
 *   not get. So the chosen one also has its outline drawn in a dark ink: a
 *   difference in lightness against pale walls, which reads whatever colours
 *   somebody sees.
 *
 * WHICH LINES
 *   The roof lines and the corners, worked out from the building's blocks
 *   rather than from its triangles — see outline.ts for why the triangles
 *   gave a tangle.
 *
 * THE LINE'S WEIGHT
 *   Thin and a dark green-grey close up, where the building fills the view
 *   and a heavy black line would be the loudest thing on the screen. Heavier
 *   as the camera pulls back, so that from across the city the outline is
 *   still there to find. The width is in screen pixels — drei's <Line> draws
 *   lines as thin quads, because a plain WebGL line is one pixel everywhere.

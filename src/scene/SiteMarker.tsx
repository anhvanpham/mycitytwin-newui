/*
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE PIN AND THE NAME ON THE CHOSEN PLACE
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The teardrop marker and the name chip that sit above whatever place is
 *   currently chosen — an approved development, or an existing building
 *   somebody searched for.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ONE COMPONENT AND NOT TWO
 *   It used to take a Development, which meant only a proposal could ever be
 *   marked. Searching an existing building therefore moved the camera and lit
 *   the building pink but left the pin and the name floating over whichever
 *   proposal had been chosen before — one place highlighted, a different one
 *   labelled. Taking a plain point and a label instead means there is one
 *   marker, on one place, and it cannot disagree with itself.
 *
 * WHY BOTH SIT OUTSIDE <WorldFrame>
 *   They are HTML, not 3D objects. The browser's own 3D transform does not
 *   survive being nested inside the frame's rotation, so each converts its
 *   own position. See StreetLabels for the longer version.

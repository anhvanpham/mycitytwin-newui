 * THE 49 APPROVED PROJECTS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   Draws the proposals standing in the city, and makes them clickable.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES
 *   - Builds each proposal's shape once and keeps it.
 *   - Colours each by what can be done with it (see below).
 *   - Outlines the one being read about (SelectionEdges).
 *   - Opens a proposal on a DOUBLE click at a desk, and on a single pull of
 *     the trigger in a headset (see WHY A DOUBLE CLICK below).
 *   - Tells a click apart from the end of a camera drag (tap.ts).
 *   - Frees the old shapes on the GPU when the set is replaced.
 *
 * WHY A DOUBLE CLICK
 *   A single click on the city is mostly the end of something else — a
 *   pan, a tap to look closer — and opening a project on it took the
 *   reader somewhere they had not asked to go. A double click is a request.
 *   In a headset it stays a single pull: aiming a laser twice at the same
 *   tower is far harder than clicking twice, and the panel is how most
 *   places are chosen there anyway.
 *
 * WHY EACH ONE IS A SEPARATE OBJECT
 *   The 1,548 existing buildings are welded into one object because nobody
 *   ever needs to click one. A proposal is different: it has to be
 *   selectable and it has to be able to change colour on its own, and
 *   neither is possible once geometry has been merged. Forty-nine objects
 *   is a cost worth paying; four and a half thousand would not be.
 *
 * WHY THE GEOMETRY IS BUILT WITHOUT KNOWING WHICH IS SELECTED
 *   Selection only changes a material. Rebuilding the shapes when it
 *   changes meant re-extruding and re-welding all 49 on every click, which
 *   was a visible pause. The shapes are built once; the colour is decided
 *   at draw time.
 *
 * COLOUR SAYS WHAT CAN BE DONE
 *
 *   selected     full mint and a dark outline — this is the one being
 *                read about
 *   clickable    strong green — plainly not an existing building, and
 *                plainly something to press
 *   not clickable  pale — in focus mode nothing responds, so nothing
 *                  should look like it will
 *
 *   Colour that invites a click the click will not answer is worse than no
 *   invitation at all.
 *
 * WHY ONLY ONE APPEARS ON THE SUNLIGHT SCREEN
 *   Forty-nine towers casting at once buries the single shadow that screen
 *   exists to explain.

 * TRAVELLING TO A PLACE, RATHER THAN APPEARING AT IT
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The only thing that moves the camera between places. Everything else
 *   states WHERE the camera should be; this decides how it gets there.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM IT SOLVES
 *   Searching an address used to teleport the view. One frame you were
 *   looking at the whole grid, the next you were beside a tower — with
 *   nothing in between to say which direction it was in or how far you had
 *   come. The city is the argument this product makes, and arriving by
 *   teleport throws away the one thing a 3D view offers over a list: you
 *   can see where a place IS.
 *
 * WHY THE CAMERA IS DRIVEN IMPERATIVELY
 *   The obvious approach — animate the numbers in React state and pass them
 *   down — re-renders the whole scene sixty times a second to move one
 *   object. This runs in the frame loop instead and touches nothing but the
 *   camera and the orbit target, so a flight costs no React work at all.
 *
 *   It also means the Canvas must be given a camera position ONCE and never
 *   again, and OrbitControls must not be given a `target` prop. Either would
 *   be re-applied on the next render and snap the camera back mid-flight,
 *   which looks exactly like the teleport this file exists to remove.
 *
 * INTERRUPTION IS NOT AN EDGE CASE
 *   A flight that ignores the mouse is worse than no flight. OrbitControls
 *   fires `start` the moment a drag or a wheel begins, and that abandons the
 *   journey where it stands. The person is now driving; the destination was
 *   only ever a suggestion.
 *
 * WHAT IT WILL NOT DO
 *   It never touches the sun, the light, or any geometry — only the camera.
 *   Nothing here can change what a shadow does, only where you watch it from.

/*
 * The sky behind the city — a dome we colour ourselves.
 *
 * WHY NOT THE ATMOSPHERIC MODEL
 *   three ships a Preetham sky, and it was used here first. It is a DAYLIGHT
 *   model: its fragment shader carries a hard floor, `vec3 L0 = vec3( 0.1 ) *
 *   Fex;`, which does not fall however far below the horizon the sun goes.
 *   Midnight rendered the colour of an overcast afternoon, the stars were
 *   invisible against it, and the fix was to cover it with an opaque dome —
 *   at which point the atmospheric model was being paid for and then hidden.
 *
 *   Colouring the dome directly loses the scattering physics and gains three
 *   things worth more here: a night that is genuinely dark, one code path
 *   from noon to midnight, and a sky drawn from the same arithmetic as the
 *   ground it meets. That last one is what stops a seam appearing at the
 *   horizon, which the two-colour-paths version could not avoid.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS IN THE FRAME
 *   Outside <WorldFrame>, with the camera — so by the rule in frame.ts the
 *   sun direction is converted once, here, at the boundary.
 *
 * HOW IT IS COLOURED
 *   Per vertex, not per pixel. A sphere of 64 by 32 is 2,145 vertices and the
 *   card interpolates between them; a gradient this smooth needs nothing
 *   finer, and it avoids shipping a shader to do it.

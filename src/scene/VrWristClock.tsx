 * THE HOUR, ON THE WRIST
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS
 *   WebXR's `dom-overlay` is in practice an AR feature: in an immersive-vr
 *   session no DOM is drawn at all. This was, for a while, the only thing a
 *   headset could read. The panel (VrPanel) now carries the hour as well, but
 *   the panel can be minimised or put away — and A and B move the sun either
 *   way. A control whose effect cannot be read is not a control, and time is
 *   the one number the whole product is about, so the hour stays on the
 *   wrist whatever the panel is doing.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ON THE WRIST AND NOT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE
 *   Anything pinned to the head is in the way permanently and cannot be
 *   looked AT — it moves as your eyes reach it. It is also one of the more
 *   reliable ways to make somebody feel unwell, because it is the one thing
 *   in the scene that never responds to the head moving.
 *
 *   A watch is checked by choosing to check it, and ignored the rest of the
 *   time. It costs nothing when it is not wanted, which for a view whose
 *   subject is the city is most of the time.
 *
 * WHY THE TEXT IS PAINTED RATHER THAN TYPESET
 *   drei's <Text> would need a font, and troika fetches a default one from a
 *   CDN — an external request this app does not make, and one that would
 *   fail behind the same strictness that keeps the Mapbox token out of the
 *   bundle. A 2D canvas needs nothing, uses the fonts already on the device,
 *   and is the approach groundSurface.ts already takes for the same reason.
 *
 * COLOUR
 *   Near-white on near-black, separated by lightness alone at about 15:1.
 *   Nothing here is distinguished by hue, so it reads the same to any colour
 *   vision and through a lens that is not colour-accurate at the edges.

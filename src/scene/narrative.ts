/*
 * Plain English for what the shadow is doing right now.
 *
 * The design writes lines like "Shadow falls east of the protected area" and
 * "Direct sun remains on the forecourt". Both name a protected public space,
 * and there is no protected-space data — that is user story 1.3, and the
 * backend carries no table for it. Inventing a forecourt to make the sentence
 * match the mock would put a claim about a real street in front of a
 * resident on the strength of nothing.
 *
 * So these sentences say only what the geometry actually supports: which way
 * the shadow runs, and how far. When 1.3 lands, the named space can be
 * substituted in and the shape of the sentence does not change.

 * "HOW MUCH SUN DOES THIS BUILDING TAKE FROM HERE?"
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The measurement behind the number on the Sunlight screen. Click a spot
 *   on the ground and this walks the whole day in ten-minute steps, asking
 *   at each one whether the subject is standing between that spot and the
 *   sun, and adds up the minutes where it is.
 *
 * THE SUBJECT IS JUST A LIST OF PARTS
 *   It used to take a whole proposal, though it only ever read the parts out
 *   of one. Taking the parts themselves means an existing building — also a
 *   list of parts — is measured by identical arithmetic. Nothing in the
 *   geometry ever cared whether the thing was already built or merely
 *   approved.
 *
 * WHY THE NUMBER IS A DIFFERENCE, NOT A TOTAL
 *   It answers "what does THIS ONE building cost this spot", not "how sunny
 *   is this spot". The second question needs every surrounding building and
 *   the real slope of the ground to be right, and neither is. The first only
 *   needs the subject itself, which is modelled exactly.
 *
 *   The consequence, stated on the card too: a spot already sitting in some
 *   existing building's shadow will still be reported as losing sun here.
 *
 * THE GEOMETRY, IN PLAIN TERMS
 *   Stand at the spot and look towards the sun. Walk up that line of sight.
 *   Every metre you rise, you also move a fixed distance horizontally
 *   towards the sun — 1/tan(altitude) of it. So the line of sight, seen
 *   from above, is just a straight line running towards the sun.
 *
 *   A building is a footprint with a bottom and a top. The line of sight
 *   passes through it exactly when the piece of that straight line between
 *   the building's bottom height and its top height crosses the footprint.
 *
 *   That makes the test a flat one: does this segment cross this polygon?
 *   No stepping along the ray, no approximation — it is exact, and it is
 *   why the whole day costs almost nothing to compute.
 *
 *              sun
 *               ╲
 *                ╲          ← line of sight, rising towards the sun
 *         ┌────┐  ╲

 *         │    │    ╲
 *      ───┴────┴─────●───    ← the spot being measured
 *          building
 *
 * THE TEST THAT MATTERS MOST
 *   In sunlightAt.test.ts: a spot NORTH of the tower loses nothing, in any
 *   season. In Melbourne the sun never passes south of overhead, so it can
 *   never throw a shadow northwards. If that test ever passes minutes, the
 *   hemisphere has been flipped somewhere.

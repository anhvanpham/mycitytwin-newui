/*
 * Parks, gardens and civic squares.
 *
 * These are the public spaces the user stories are about — "the square they
 * eat lunch in", the ground whose sunlight is worth protecting. Without them
 * the model is buildings and roads, and a resident has nothing to locate
 * themselves by beyond a street name.
 *
 * Two filters were applied when the fixture was cut, and both matter:
 *
 *   OS_CATEGOR  keeps parks, gardens and civic squares, dropping the 68
 *               university campuses and the school grounds that the source
 *               also counts as open space.
 *   OS_ACCESS   keeps only "Open". A locked university lawn is open space on
 *               a map and not a park to somebody on a lunch break.

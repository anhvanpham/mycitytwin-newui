 * FLAT OUTLINES  →  SOLID BUILDINGS
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   The step that gives the city height. It takes the outlines the adapter
 *   produced and turns each into a three-dimensional solid the renderer can
 *   draw and the sun can be blocked by.
 *
 * HOW EXTRUSION WORKS
 *   A footprint is a flat shape. Extruding it means sweeping it upwards and
 *   putting walls down the sides — the same motion as a biscuit cutter,
 *   except the result is filled. three.js does the work; this file decides
 *   what shape goes in and how far up it sweeps.
 *
 * THE PART THAT IS NOT OBVIOUS: WHY MERGE
 *   Drawing 4,443 separate solids means telling the graphics card 4,443
 *   times per frame to draw something, and the shadow pass doubles it. Each
 *   of those instructions costs more than the triangles inside it. Welded
 *   into one object, the whole city is a single instruction.
 *
 *   The trade is that a merged object cannot be clicked or coloured
 *   individually — which is why the 49 developments are NOT merged together
 *   (see DevelopmentMassings.tsx) while the 1,548 background buildings are.
 *
 * "LOD1"
 *   The standard term for this kind of model: flat-topped blocks at the
 *   right footprint and the right height, with no roof shape, no windows and
 *   no detail. It is what shadow work uses, because an outline and a height
 *   are what decide where a shadow falls; a pitched roof changes the picture
 *   and barely changes the shadow.

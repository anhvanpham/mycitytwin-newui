 *   covers — not because the sun does anything at either end. Drawn as a
 *   plain track it says the day is a featureless fourteen hours, and the

 *   Melbourne that band is four and a half hours shorter than on 21
 *   December, and seeing that is most of the point of a seasonal control.
 *
 * HOW IT IS FOUND
 *   By sampling, then bisecting. The altitude is a smooth function crossing
 *   zero twice a day, so a coarse scan finds the two brackets and eight
 *   halvings pin each to under a minute — which is finer than the ten-minute
 *   step the control moves in.
 *

 * WHERE THE SUN IS, AS A DIRECTION
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS
 *   Small conversions between how astronomers describe the sun's position
 *   and what a 3D scene needs. solar.ts works out the angles; this turns
 *   them into arrows and distances.
 *
 * THE TWO ANGLES
 *
 *   ALTITUDE   how high, in degrees. 0 is the horizon, 90 is overhead.
 *              In Melbourne it never quite reaches 76.
 *
 *   AZIMUTH    which way, in degrees clockwise from north.
 *              0 = north, 90 = east, 180 = south, 270 = west.
 *
 * THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE
 *   Melbourne is at latitude −37.8, so the sun crosses the sky to the NORTH
 *   and shadows point SOUTH. Northern-hemisphere intuition is exactly
 *   backwards here, and code written on that intuition produces shadows
 *   that look completely convincing and are reversed. Every function below
 *   is tested against reference data for this reason.
 *
 * WHY SHADOW LENGTH IS height / tan(altitude)
 *   The sun, the top of the building and the tip of its shadow make a right
 *   triangle. The height is the opposite side, the shadow is the adjacent
 *   side, and the angle between the ground and the sunlight is the altitude.
 *   tan = opposite / adjacent, so adjacent = opposite / tan. As the sun
 *   drops, tan shrinks and the shadow runs away: at 45° it equals the
 *   height, at 5° it is eleven times it.

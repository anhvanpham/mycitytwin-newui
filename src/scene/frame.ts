 * WHICH WAY IS UP  (read this before touching anything in scene/)
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * TWO CONVENTIONS, AND THE ONE PLACE THEY MEET
 *
 *   This app        +x EAST   +y NORTH   +z UP      metres
 *   three.js        +x right  +y UP      +z toward the viewer
 *
 *   Surveying puts up on Z. 3D graphics puts up on Y. Both are correct and
 *   they disagree, so somewhere the two have to be reconciled.
 *
 * WHERE IT HAPPENS: EXACTLY ONCE
 *   <WorldFrame> is a group rotated -90° about X, and the entire city lives
 *   inside it. Within that group, x/y/z mean east/north/up and no file needs
 *   to know three.js thinks otherwise. Buildings, roads, parks, the sun and
 *   its arrow are all inside.
 *
 *   A few things cannot be: the camera, and the labels that are really HTML.
 *   Those call `enuToWorld` to state a position in the outer frame.
 *
 * THE RULE, AND WHY IT IS TESTED
 *   Inside the frame, never convert. Outside the frame, always convert.
 *
 *   Breaking it does not cause a crash or a type error — both sides are
 *   three numbers — it just puts something in the wrong place, or on its
 *   side. It has happened twice: the street names ended up face-down under
 *   the road, and the measurement ring stood on its edge in mid-air. Both
 *   times the cause was copying a component from the other side of the
 *   boundary. frame-boundary.test.ts now checks it mechanically.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST WORK IN THREE.JS'S FRAME
 *   Because every input is surveyed data — eastings, northings and heights
 *   above sea level — and every output is a claim about a real place. Doing
 *   the arithmetic in the frame the data arrives in means the numbers in the
 *   code can be checked against the numbers on a map.

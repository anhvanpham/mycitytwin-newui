 * STANDING IN THE STREET, IN A HEADSET
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS
 *   Where the player is, in a headset, and how they move. It began as the VR
 *   half of the pedestrian view — StreetView is the same idea driven by a
 *   mouse and four keys — and now also puts the player on the platform over
 *   the city, carries them between the two in a fade (THE CUT, below), and
 *   hands the controller buttons that are not the laser's to the panel.
 *   Where each place is comes from vrPlacement.ts; this file only goes there.
 *
 * WHAT COMES FOR NOTHING, AND WHAT DOES NOT
 *   Looking around is free. WebXR drives the camera from the headset's own
 *   tracking, so all 360° of it — and leaning, and crouching to look up at a
 *   tower — need no code at all. This file does not touch the camera and must
 *   not: anything written to it is overwritten by the device before the frame
 *   is drawn, which looks like the code being ignored rather than like a rule
 *   being broken.
 *
 *   Moving is not free, and neither is being stopped by a wall.
 *
 * WHY THE STICKS ARE READ HERE RATHER THAN BY useXRControllerLocomotion
 *   The library ships a locomotion hook and this used to use it. Two things
 *   it cannot do, both of which were asked for:
 *
 *     Speed by deflection. It multiplies the raw axes by a single `speed`, so
 *     the fastest the stick can go is the only speed there is. A run at the
 *     gate and a walk short of it needs a curve — see paceFor.
 *
 *     Proportional turning. Its smooth mode reads the SIGN of the stick and
 *     nothing else (`(x < 0 ? -1 : 1) * delta * speed`), so a nudge turns at
 *     exactly the rate a shove does.
 *
 *   It also hands the same Vector3 back every frame and only writes to it
 *   when the stick has moved, so a frame that is purely a turn arrives
 *   carrying the last step — which drifted the player sideways every time
 *   they looked around. Reading the two sticks directly costs about fifteen
 *   lines and removes all three problems.
 *
 * WHERE IT SITS IN THE FRAME
 *   OUTSIDE <WorldFrame>, like the camera — so every position it states has
 *   to go through `enuToWorld`. It does not call that itself: every placement
 *   goes through `originFor` in vrPlacement.ts, which does, and
 *   frame-boundary.test.ts checks both files by name. Breaking it does not
 *   crash: it stands the player on their side, or underground.
 *
 * THE THREE PLACES A POSITION LIVES, WHICH ARE NOT THE SAME PLACE
 *   east/north    what the data is in, and what the walls are indexed in
 *   three.js      (east, up, −north) — what the renderer draws in
 *   the origin    the floor under the player, which is NOT the player
 *
 *   That last one is the whole difficulty. The app can only move the floor;
 *   the person is wherever they have walked to on it. Every question is asked
 *   of the head and every answer is applied to the floor. See vrLocomotion.ts.

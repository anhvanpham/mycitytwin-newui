/*
 * Fetching the map image, and doing without it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS ALLOWED TO FAIL SILENTLY
 *   Every other layer read from outside works this way — a missing park layer
 *   is not worth an error in front of anyone — and the map has one more way
 *   to go wrong than the rest: it is the only thing in the app that depends
 *   on a third party still being there. A token that has been rotated, a
 *   month's quota spent, an aeroplane. In all of them the city should keep
 *   standing on the plain ground it stood on before, which is exactly what
 *   returning null does.
 *
 *   That matters more than it looks, because a frozen release cannot be
 *   rebuilt. mycitytwin.com/ver-1/ has to keep working in week 12, and it
 *   will — just without its map.
 *
 * THE TOKEN
 *   Handed in rather than read from the bundle — see data/mapboxConfig.ts,
 *   which explains why it is fetched at run time and not compiled in. Null
 *   config means no token was deployed, which is the ordinary state for
 *   anyone who clones this and runs it: no request, no map, nothing else
 *   changed.
